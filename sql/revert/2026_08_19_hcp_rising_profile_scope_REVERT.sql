-- REVERT ARTIFACT for the hcp_rising_profile scope resolution. 2026-08-19.
-- Branch: resurfacing
-- Covers: migrations/2026_08_19_hcp_rising_profile_scope.sql
--
-- CAPTURED BEFORE ANYTHING WAS APPLIED, from pg_get_functiondef on the live database.
-- Verifiably pre-change: est_us is pinned to scope_type='region' AND scope_value='US'
-- with no scope_label, and the h CTE has no effective_country.
--
-- WHAT REVERTING COSTS: dual-board members without a US row go back to reading "NOT ON
-- THE ESTABLISHED BOARD" over a paragraph naming their global rank. Revert the FRONTEND
-- FIRST (git) -- the standing card reads established_us.scope_label, and without it the
-- card renders `undefined` where the scope word belongs.
--
-- DATA: none. STABLE, read-only function.
